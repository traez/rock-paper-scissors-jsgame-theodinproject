In fact my first in my transition to programing journey.
I'm so proud of me, on that baby step levels.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I've been on a Tutorial Hell run all this while, just learning JavaScript.  
This is actually my first attempt using it as a solution to solve problems/meet a need.  
90% of the code was "cloned". But understanding is at 100%, and that's what matters.  

### Continued development

I will get better with more practice. 

### Useful resources

The Odin Project, YouTube, MDN, Google
