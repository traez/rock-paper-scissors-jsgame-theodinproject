This is a solution to the [Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors). I am trying to improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- This was the first project I was challenged with when I started The Odin Project. Months later, and with all round better competency, I complete it flawlessly and independently.  

### Continued development

Next 4 projects I do should be Fetch API based, then will move on to another chapter in my Web Development mastery journey.
